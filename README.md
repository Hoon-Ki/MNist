MNist tutorial

Classify handwritten digits using the famous MNIST data

Get started on this competition through Kaggle Scripts

The goal in this competition is to take an image of a handwritten single digit, and determine what that digit is.  As the competition progresses, we will release tutorials which explain different machine learning algorithms and help you to get started.


The data for this competition were taken from the MNIST dataset. The MNIST ("Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology") dataset is a classic within the Machine Learning community that has been extensively studied.  More detail about the dataset, including Machine Learning algorithms that have been tried on it and their levels of success, can be found at http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/index.html.


I will show you from simple one ,like single layered neural network, to complicated one ,like CNN using batch normalization and xavier initialization.

so.. see you soon.

이 튜토리얼은 간단한 뉴럴넷부터 batch normalization 과 xavier initialization을 사용한 CNN을 보여드릴것 입니다.
많은 도움이 되길 바랍니다.
